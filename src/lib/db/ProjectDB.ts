For this project, I focused primarily on **website development**, working alongside one designer.  
Together, we translated the vision into a functioning platform that balanced design consistency with technical execution.  

---

### Key Challenge  

The biggest challenge wasn’t technical—it was **communication**.  
A new project manager had just stepped in, and the transition created gaps in coordination.  

Despite this, we:  
- Streamlined workflows to reduce miscommunication.  
- Took initiative in clarifying requirements and priorities.  
- Maintained steady progress to ensure delivery on time.  

---

### Our Role  

My responsibilities included:  
- **Website development** (front-end and CMS setup)  
- Collaborating closely with the designer for **UI consistency**  
- Ensuring the site was optimized for **performance and accessibility**  

---

**The result?**  
Even with communication hurdles, the project was successfully completed—  
demonstrating our ability to **adapt under shifting management** while delivering a platform that met stakeholder expectations. `,

This required careful auditing and cleanup to ensure consistency.  

To address this, we:  
- Fixed **resource conflicts** and ensured proper versioning.  
- Resolved **content synchronization issues** between different pages.  
- Improved the overall **stability and reliability** of the website.  

---

### My Role

Different working styles and overlapping responsibilities sometimes slowed us down.  

Still, we learned to **adapt and coordinate better as a team**,  
and by the end, we had successfully **completed the website build**.  

---

### What Happened Next  

Unfortunately, due to **management-level issues on the client’s side**,  
the website was **never officially published**.  

Even so, the project gave me invaluable experience in:  
- **Collaborating across roles** (design, copy, and dev).  
- **Improving communication** in a multi-disciplinary team.

---

### Key Challenge  

Managing **seven languages** and **multiple country variations** was no small feat—  
especially since we were working in **Webflow**, which at the time had no built-in localization features.  

To make it work, we:  
- Designed a **custom environment setup** for multilingual management.  
- Ensured **data separation** between countries when required.  
- Maintained a consistent, high-quality UX across all versions.  

---

### Our Role in Maintenance

### Key Challenge  

The most difficult part of the project was handling the **product listing system**.  
Because **Webflow does not support CMS within CMS**, we had to get creative—  
developing alternative solutions to make the structure scalable and maintainable.  

To overcome this, we:  
- Designed a workaround for **complex product categorization**.  
- Structured data to ensure **accuracy and flexibility**.
